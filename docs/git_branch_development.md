## Personal Project Development and Deployment Process

This document outlines the development and deployment process for your personal dbt project. As the sole developer, you have the flexibility to streamline the workflow according to your preferences.

Setting Up Your Development Environment

Install Git and VS Code

Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

Set Up Your Project

Create a new repository on GitHub for your project.

Clone the repository to your local environment using Git:

git clone https://github.com/jrdegbe/DBT-Warehouse

Configure Git to associate your commits with your name and email:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Open the project folder in VS Code:

code path/to/your-repository

Install dbt and Its Dependencies

Install dbt by following the instructions in the dbt documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation.

Install any additional packages or dependencies required for your project. Refer to the documentation for your specific project's dependencies.
Development Process

Scope your development work according to your project's requirements and objectives.

Follow these general steps for development:

Create a new branch for your development work:

git checkout -b my-development-branch

Implement your dbt models, tests, and documentation using VS Code.

Regularly compile your models to verify correctness:

dbt run --model my_cool_model

Use your preferred SQL IDE to analyze the results of your changes.

Compile the entire dbt project to ensure all models are up-to-date:


dbt run

Test the project to ensure the correctness of your models:

dbt test

Commit your changes to your development branch:

git add -A

git commit -m "Description of changes"

Push your development branch to the remote repository:

git push origin my-development-branch

Deployment Process

Decide on your deployment strategy based on your project's needs.

As the sole developer, you have the flexibility to deploy directly from your development branch or follow a more formal release process. Choose the approach that suits your project's requirements.

Before deploying, ensure the following:

Your development branch satisfies the requirements and objectives of your project.

The branch successfully compiles and passes all tests.

You have generated and reviewed the updated documentation.

Deploy the project based on your chosen strategy.

Additional Considerations

Make sure to keep your local and remote repositories in sync by regularly pulling changes from the remote repository.

Consider setting up backups or version control systems for your project to safeguard against data loss or accidental changes.

Customize the development and deployment processes to fit your personal workflow and preferences.


Version Control and Collaboration (Optional)

Since you're the sole developer of your personal project, the need for extensive version control and collaboration might be minimal. However, it's still a good practice to maintain a version control system and consider the following:

Initialize a Git repository within your project folder:

git init

Make regular commits to track your project's changes:

git add -A

git commit -m "Description of changes"

Optionally, create branches for experimental features or different development paths:

git checkout -b my-feature-branch

If you're working on multiple machines or want to keep an offsite backup, consider pushing your repository to a remote Git hosting service like GitHub or GitLab:

Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab.

Follow the instructions provided by the hosting service to add a remote repository:

git remote add origin <https://github.com/jrdegbe/DBT-Warehouse>

Push your local repository to the remote repository:

git push -u origin master (or the name of your main branch)


Development Environment Customization

As the sole developer, you have the flexibility to customize your development environment based on your preferences and tooling choices. Here are some additional considerations:

VS Code Extensions: Explore and install relevant VS Code extensions for dbt, SQL, and any other tools or languages you're working with.

Custom Configurations: Customize your VS Code settings, such as code formatting rules, linter configurations, and keyboard shortcuts, to align with your preferences.

dbt-Specific Tooling: Explore dbt-specific extensions, plugins, or integrations available for VS Code that can enhance your development experience. For example, you can install the "dbt-labs.dbt" extension to leverage dbt-specific functionalities directly within VS Code.

Remember to regularly update your development tools, extensions, and dependencies to take advantage of the latest features, bug fixes, and improvements.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (Optional)

As a sole developer, setting up a full continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline might not be necessary. However, if you'd like to automate certain tasks or ensure consistency in your deployment process, you can explore lightweight CI/CD tools or frameworks that align with your project's requirements. These tools can help with tasks such as running tests, compiling dbt models, and deploying changes to your production environment.

Consider the following options:

GitHub Actions: GitHub provides an integrated CI/CD platform called GitHub Actions. You can define workflows that automatically execute certain tasks based on events like push or pull requests.

Jenkins: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that can be used to set up custom CI/CD pipelines tailored to your specific project requirements.

Evaluate your project's needs and choose the level of automation and deployment that makes sense for your personal project.
